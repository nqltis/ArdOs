# ArdOs

Repository of the Arduino code for the following project : 
https://hackaday.io/project/188105-pocket-arduino-microcomputer 

It is a minimalist operating system for an ATmega328P with 16x2 LCD display and 16 buttons keypad.

You can use this code freely anywhere, it is not very complex anyway. It may not be very clean in some parts,
I've written all this code by myself and did not plan at first to let anyone read it. 
The whole code is segmented into libraries for better understanding and clearer code, feel free to use what you need.

If you have any question and/or advice, please ask me.
